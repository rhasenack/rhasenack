### Hello, I'm Ricardo and I am a full-stack software developer!

## About me
By training, I'm a Mechanical Engineer, who has worked in research, numerical simulation, and manufacturing engineering. 

Since graduation, my career has shifted towards IT consulting, working with Siemens Preactor/Opcenter, implementing and giving software support to many industries across Brazil. 

More recently, I attended a web development bootcamp, with the goal of fully transitioning my career to become a developer.
